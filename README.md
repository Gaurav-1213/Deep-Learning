# Intro
Broadly speaking, deep learning is a more approachable name for an artificial neural network. The “deep” in deep learning refers to the depth of the network. An artificial neural network can be very shallow.
Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the cerebral cortex. At the basic level is the perceptron, the mathematical representation of a biological neuron. Like in the cerebral cortex, there can be several layers of interconnected perceptrons.
The first layer is the input layer. Each node in this layer takes an input, and then passes its output as the input to each node in the next layer. There are generally no connections between nodes in the same layer and the last layer produces the outputs.
We call the middle part the hidden layer. These neurons have no connection to the outside (e.g. input or output) and are only activated by nodes in the previous layer.
Google is now using deep learning to manage the energy at the company’s data centers. They’ve cut their energy needs for cooling by 40%. That translates to about a 15% improvement in power usage efficiency for the company and hundreds of millions of dollars in savings.
